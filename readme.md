# Trig Generator

A little program I wrote for a high school trigonometry math project.

Approximates the sine function using the taylor series, and uses that to approximate all the other trig functions.

This project uses SDL for windowing and opengl context creation, and uses Sean Barrett's stb_image.h for image loading.
